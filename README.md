# Math-Rotating-Coil
Basic principle of Harmonic Coils technique

## Introduction
- For most accelerator magnets, a harmonic
description of the field is often used, both for
characterizing the field quality, as well as for
particle tracking studies.

- The “Harmonic Coil” technique, employing
rotating coils, is the most convenient,
accurate, and widely used technique for the
measurement of harmonic coefficients in
accelerator magnets.

## Basic Principle
- The harmonic coefficients are related to the
azimuthal variation of the field components.

- A rotating coil (loop of wire) measures the
azimuthal variation of the intercepted flux.
The field harmonics are then deduced using
a knowledge of the geometry of the coil.
